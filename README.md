<h1>Random Colorful Box Generater</h1>
This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple web page with five boxes, each assigned a random color and background. It serves as a basic example of DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation for styling elements dynamically.
<h1>Usage</h1>
The web page will display five boxes with randomly assigned colors and backgrounds each time you refresh the page. This project is a starting point for experimenting with DOM concepts in web development.
